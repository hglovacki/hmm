Here’s where I’d like to leave a breadcrumb trail, with at least one entry per month, through how music maps.  What I mean with this phrase is how music delivery now—

And right on cue, Frank Ocean’s contract with Spotify looks to have lapsed.  I’m sure there’s major implications for streaming and record companies  The point is he prompted this blog post by pushing Geto Boys’ “Mind Playing Tricks on Me” into his Spotify playlist (now sans his own songs).  

This time I’m thinking about samples.  I had stumbled upon the Atmosphere sample of Eroica (here), and was thus led to the other classical samples listed here.  

The Eroica takes a pregnant moment—the only minor key coda in a very upbeat finale.  Atmosphere deftly lets it breathe, record pops and all, matching the

Imitation being the sincerest form of flattery.  Does the opposite hold?  Perhaps. Kool A.D. may agree,

Mind Playing Tricks on me shows incredible vulnerability.  If the storytelling of gangsta rap, exemplified by the following verse—full of violence and street — encloses such a soft seed, what is it that trap rap, 20+ years from now, will be shown to’ve foreseen.

Lynguistics is just a marvelous sample; a huge moment in the first movement of the tchaikovsky concerto for violin.  The kind of moment a perfomer might dread coming to, if underprepared, and worse—the 30 seconds are repeated over 3 minutes!  However the result is not angst, but triumph.  A virtuosic moment repeated, as you might in a practice room—the performance here is the practice reps.  Plus the marimba.

Kelis, like JayZ and Kanye west in Otis, take a similarly virtuosic moment and repeat it.  But unlike in the Cunninlynguists and Atmosphere, they don’t let it breathe.  Both samples

The new Janelle Monáe track is on here for good measure, just because it’s great.  But I suppose if the bass line and toungue clucks aren’t just perfectly pungent and plosive, you had better plug into a better system.


In future I’m looking forward to talking about Kendrick Lamar’s Black Panther Album, Johnny Greenwood’s Phantom Thread, and Leonidas Kavakos’ bow arm.

1. The reference for Transportin’ is the Geto Boys track, not the Hayes, whereas the reference for the Geto Boys track is the Hayes.  In this way the Geto Boys captures the contemplative nature of
    1. cf. the contemplative nature of Try a Little Tenderness.  The lack of contemplativeness perhaps why Otis is a dissapointing track.  However; Kanye as a producer can produce results.  But he does so not by sampling but by pastiche-izing.
